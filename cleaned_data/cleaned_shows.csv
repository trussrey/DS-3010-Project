4565,I'll Fly Away,3,39,I'll Fly Away is an American drama television series set during the late 1950s and early 1960s  in an unspecified Southern U.S. state. It aired on NBC from 1991 to 1993 and starred Regina Taylor as Lilly Harper  a black housekeeper for the family of district attorney Forrest Bedford  whose name is an ironic reference to Nathan Bedford Forrest  the founder of the Ku Klux Klan. As the show progressed  Lilly became increasingly involved in the Civil Rights Movement  with events eventually drawing in Forrest as well.  I'll Fly Away won two 1992 Emmy Awards  and 23 nominations in total. It won three Humanitas Prizes  two Golden Globe Awards  two NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Drama Series  and a Peabody Award. However  the series was never a ratings blockbuster  and it was canceled by NBC in 1993  despite widespread protests by critics and viewer organizations.  After the program's cancellation  a two-hour movie  I'll Fly Away: Then and Now  was produced  in order to resolve dangling storylines from Season 2  and provide the series with a true finale. The movie aired on October 11  1993 on PBS. Its major storyline closely paralleled the true story of the 1955 murder of Emmett Till in Money  Mississippi.
